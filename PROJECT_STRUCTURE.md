Notes:

- End user install: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningzimu/Agent-Email/main/install.sh | sh`.
- The CLI JSON contract is documented in `docs/CLI_JSON_CONTRACT.md` and locked
  by schemas under `docs/cli_json_schemas/`.
- Python/MCP implementation has been removed; remaining legacy docs are kept in
  `docs/archive/` for reference.
