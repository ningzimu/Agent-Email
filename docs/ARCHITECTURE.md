# Architecture

Mailbox is a CLI-first Node.js project.

Core goals:

- Keep a stable JSON output contract for automation/skills.
- Store config and data using XDG defaults with env overrides.
- Support both interactive use and scripted `--json` usage.

Modules:

- `packages/shared`: flag parsing, JSON printing, XDG paths.
- `packages/core`: IMAP/SMTP operations, sqlite cache, account loading/migration.
- `packages/workflows`: digest/monitor/inbox orchestration.
- `packages/cli`: CLI command surface.

Distribution:

- The user-facing install downloads prebuilt `mailbox` binaries from GitHub Releases.
- Release binaries are built from Node via `pkg` for macOS arm64/x64 and Linux x64.
